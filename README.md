**About Me**

Hi, I'm Angela Wang! I'm a computer science student who loves building systems that bring together logic and creativity. Lately, I’ve been exploring projects in machine learning, data analysis, backend development, and automation, especially ones that connect tech with language, communication, or finance.

Feel free to reach out — I’m always up for learning something new or collaborating on something meaningful!
